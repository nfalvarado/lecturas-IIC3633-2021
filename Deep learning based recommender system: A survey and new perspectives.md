# Deep learning based recommender system: A survey and new perspectives. 

This paper is about the use of Deep Learning in recommender systems. 
The survey is written in an orderly manner and in a way that is comfortable to read. It's a good summary of the basics of recommender systems and deep learning. 
his makes it better understood what the authors want to propose when these two areas are mixed. Specifically, the authors discuss different 
architectures in the world of deep learning. Also, in the paper the authors explain the strengths of deep learning based recommendation models. 
These are:

1. Nonlinear Transformation.
2. Representation Learning.
3. Sequence Modeling.
4. Fexibility.

Solutions with the use of deep learning are quite popular these days. This shows versatility and creativity, allowing to researchers consider 
more and give importance to this techniques. But of course, this area has their own limitations such as:

1. Interpretability. 
2. Data requirement.
3. Extensive hyperparameter tuning

An important point to discuss, is the mention that the authors do to the relevance of deep learning in natural language processing and computer vision. 
A lot of recommender systems use multimedia. In fact, the development of the recommender systems come from contests given by big enterprises.

Also, this survey makes a good introduction to the state of the art in recommender systemas based on deep learning. 
Plus, an interesting technique we have in recommendation with deep hybrid models. As we can blend more than one technique of recommendation system, 
it is not unreasonable to think that we can mix more than one model. In fact, we can use more than one deep learning technique, 
and because of the flexibility of deep neural networks it possible to combine neural building blocks to complement one another, forming a hybrid model. 

To finalize, is interesting that we can study the behavior of different areas in order to have one powerful blend and get better results. 
Is a good way to start the future work in this area and achieve a good performance in this context. 
Deep learning is an area with many possibilities and a lot of potential to be developed in a good way. I
believe this will give many years of good study and it is exciting to be aware of this growth.
