# Interactive recommender systems: A survey of the state of the art and future research challenges and opportunities.

This paper presents a strong survey that talks a lot of recommender systems. Specifically recommendation algorithms and 
their limitations, visualization techniques, challenges and opportunities. 
About the recommendation algorithms, it is interesting the rising of the importance in the recommendation process. 
This gives us another perspective on how to work this part of the recommender systems. 
It is important to have a management of the operation locally and globally to be able to give you a sense of optimization in each work step. 
For example, a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering represents the user as a vector of ratings over a set of films, 
but a context-aware recommender can consider who is accompanying the user  to make a more appropriate suggestion. 
There are important challenges mentioned by the authors. These challenges must be studied before recommender systems can reach their full potential.
I think this is precisely so that recommender systems can predict better and have a good performance. These challenges are:

1. Collaborative recommendation techniques often cannot make effective recommendations for new users or for new items.
2. The complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending recommended results and can lead to trust issues when recommendations fail.
3. Contextual information can be substantially enriched in nonobtrusive way by exploiting new sensors.

Another interesting thing that is mentioned in the survey is the state of the art of data visualization. 
This area has been studied for a time and it is interesting because of some graphical relationships that exist. 
For example relationships between people or a representation of a visualization timeline that gives information about the evolution of concepts over time. 
The authors precisely emphasize the use of interactive visual representations of abstract data. 
It is very striking how abstract concepts are managed to land in general, and even more so in this context.

Finally, I like how the paper was presented. It is written in a solid way that allows to analyze what has been working in recommender systems. 
I would also like to highlight the interactive visualization framework that combines the recommendation with visualization techniques. 
This allows users to gain insight into the recommendation process.
